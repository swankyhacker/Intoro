## Commit Rules 
---
1. Do not commit to the ```main/master``` branch. Create a separate branch for each feature and push to origin with your branch name. Submit your code for review through a ```pull request```.
2. Use sensible names for your branches. Prefix with ```fix``` or ```feature``` depending on the situation. For example, if you are working on the design for the login page, you can use `feature/login-page`.
3. Make sure your commit messages are able to give an idea of what work or feature you have finished in that particular commit.
4. Do not try to bypass the pre-commit hooks.
5. If you are installing new libraries, please contact me before installing it as I may be able to suggest a better alternative.
6. Try to write modular code as keep your commits as brief as possible.
