# Intoro ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ 

 Intoro is an app with researched and effective pedagogy that will help consumers to learn Japanese Kana characters in an entertaining and stress-free manner. 
 
 The purpose of the app is to lay a strong foundation regarding the elementary principles of the Japanese writing system for beginners. The scope of the app is limited to the first two scripts of the language, namely **Hiragana** and **Katakana**. 
 
 It is incorporated with features such as a **spaced repetition system**, **pre-written flashcards**, **timetable** etc to aid the tuition of the users. After using the app consistently for personal study, the user should be familiar with both of the aforementioned scripts and be able to parse through basic Japanese literature.
