    "extra_note": "*KH* あ */KH* is pronounced like *UN* \"ah!\" */UN* like when you come to a realization. It also sounds like the *UN* a *UN* in \"c*UN*a*/UN*r\"."

    "extra_note": "*KH* う */KH* is pronounced like  the *UN*oo*/UN* in \"*UN*oo*/UN*h… ahhh!\" when you're watching fireworks. In other words, it sounds like *UN*u*/UN* in \"*UN*U*/UN*NO,\" the card game, or the number one in Spanish."
